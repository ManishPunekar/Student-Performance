# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning
## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to analyze and predict student academic performance using a large-scale dataset.
The problem is approached in two parts:

Regression Task: Predicting total marks

Classification Task: Predicting student grade

The project focuses on classical machine learning algorithms and emphasizes interpretability, evaluation, and fundamental ML concepts rather than deep learning.
